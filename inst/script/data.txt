This file describes the data files included in the cmapR repository.

* example.lxb
This is an example .lxb file demonstrating the Luminex flow cytometry format.
It contains raw fluorescent intensity observations from a single well
in an L1000 experiment.

* lm_epsilon_n978.grp
This is a .grp file (one entry per line) containing the Affymetrix probeset
identifiers for the 978 L1000 landmark genes.

* lm_probes.gmx
This is a .gmx file containing lists of the multiple different L1000
landmark probe pools. It is intended to demonstrate the .gmx format.

* modzs_n25x50.gct
This is an example of a .gct file intended to demonstrate the format.
The data included are replicate-collapsed, differential expression values.

* modzs_n25x50.gctx
This file contains exactly the same data as modzs_n25x50.gct, represented
in .gctx (binary) format. It is intended to demonstrate the .gctx format.

* query_up.gmt
This is an example .gmt file containing 8 gene sets. Each gene set is
represented as a row of Affymetrix probeset identifiers. It is intended to
demonstrate the .gmt format. The gene sets were originally obtained from
MSigDB (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb)
