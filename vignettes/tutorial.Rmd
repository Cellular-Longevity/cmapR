# Introduction

This notebook will walk through some of the basic functionality in the cmapR package, which is largely centered around working with matrix data in [GCT and GCTX format](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty784), commonly used by the [Connectivity Map (CMap) project](https://clue.io). We'll be using data from one of CMap's GEO series, [GSE70138](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70138), but the steps below are applicable to any GCT or GCTX file.


# Installation

The cmapR package can be installed from Bioconductor by running the following commands in an R session.

```{r}
# TODO: fill in once package has been accepted on bioconductor
```

cmapR source code can be also obtained from [github](https://github.com/cmap/cmapR). 



# Session Info
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
